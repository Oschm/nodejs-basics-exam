# nodejs-basics-exam

This repo contains a task that allows students to test their knowledge in basic concepts of nodejs like datatypes, control flow logic and writing items to a file.This project will allow users to add, remove, update, and view contacts. Each contact will have properties such as name, phone number, and email.

## Tasks

Implement all the Functions that have TODO attached to them.
The runProgram() function contains program steps. Once you implemented a step you can uncomment a corresponding call and check if it works.

Console output should be formatted this way, use the funcion:
Name: Oliver Schmidt, PhoneNumber: +49123456789, Email: schmidt_ol@yahoo.de.

## Extra Tasks

Please implement addition tasks

### Distinct User Emails

When creating new Users it shouldn't be possible to create Users with an existing email.

### Validate Email Format:

Validate the format of the email before adding a new contact. Ensure the email follows a standard pattern (e.g., using regular expressions).

### Export Contacts:

Implement a function to export all contacts to a CSV file.
